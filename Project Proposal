Project Proposal Template

Before you start project work for a course, you should be able to complete the following proposal template, addressing the questions listed as completely as possible. However, keep in mind that throughout the design iterations of your project, many parts of it will likely change (i.e. increase/decrease in number of samples, types of features or algorithm used, etc), so this is just a starting point. Also, if you are unsure in some areas, you should still submit a partial proposal to receive feedback from instructors.

In addition to submitting this plan, you may discuss the areas below with an instructor in a scope meeting.

Question/need:

What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build? 
WHAT STATIONS TO PLACE PEOPLE AT TO COLLECT NAMES FOR THE WOMEN IN TECH GALA?
HOW MANY VOLUNTEERS WILL BE NEEDED FOR MIN, AVERAGE AND MAX COVERAGE?
WHAT TIMES SHOULD THE VOLUNTEERS BE WORKING?
WILL THE VOLUNTEERS FOCUS ON PEOPLE EXITING OR ENTERING THE STATIONS?
WHICH WAY SHOULD THE TABLE BE FACING?

Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system? 
THE CLIENT, THE WOMENT IN TECH GALA EVENT

Data Description:  THE MTA DATA IS ORGANIZED BY 

What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data? 
MTA DATA, DOWNLOADED FROM THE MTA WEBSITE, IF AVAIALBLE MAJOR TECH EMPLOYER LOCATIONS PROXIMITY TO STATIONS, IF AVAILABLE AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOOD DATA

What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? 

What characteristics/features do you expect to work with? SCP, STATION, LINENAME, TIME, EXITS, ENTRIES

If modeling, what will you predict as your target? 
STATIONS WITH HIGHEST EXITS BETWEEN 4:00AM AND 8:00AM AND HIGHEST ENTRIES BETWEEN 4:00PM(16:00) AND 8:00PM(20:00)
POTENTIALLY STATIONS SERVED MULTIPLE LINES(INTERSECTION)

Tools:

How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project? PYTHON, VISUALIZATION TOOLS TBD

Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?

MVP Goal:

What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?
A VISUALIZATION OF THE DATA INDICATING THE LOCATIONS WITH THE HIGHEST TRAFFIC STATIONS
MAP OF THE SUBWAY STATIONS MARKED WITH A RED DOT OF WHERE TO PLACE THE VOLUNTEERS
A SCHEDULE FOR VOLUNTEERS TO BE AT THE STATION
