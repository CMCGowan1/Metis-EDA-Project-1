## WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY) - Street Team Placement Initial Analysis 

The goal of this project is to better understand which NYC area MTA subway stations have the most traffic.  This analysis aims to provide insight into the minimum, maximum and average number of volunteers needed to cover the station's with the most traffic.  The desired outcome is to give the street teams the opportuntiy to connect with the highest number of individuals possible to gather email addresses for people interested in attending the annual gala and/or donating to the organization.

To start exploring this goal, I used the publically available MTA database for turnstile data from 1/1/2021 to 9/3/2021.  Pandas and matplotlib were used to clean, filter, sort and visualize the data

## EXAMPLE
w datalinear regression model with one feature to describe Box Office Total Domestic Gross as a function of the Budget of a Movie.

The figure depicts the model (red) plotted against the actual data points. The prediction interval is plotted in green.

This result suggests that budget may have a significant positive impact on a film's revenue. However, the magnitude of the model's residuals makes it clear that budget is not the only important factor in determining the success of a film.
Notes: 
- Address your project's key question/purpose. 
- That doesn't mean they necessarily answer the question, but instead that they provide something immediately functional and useful that can receive feedback and be - built upon.
- "show us what you have so far that solves the problem"
