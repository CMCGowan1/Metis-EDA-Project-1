## WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY) - Street Team Placement Initial Analysis 

The goal of this project is to better understand which NYC area MTA subway stations have the most traffic.  This analysis aims to provide insight into the minimum, maximum and average number of volunteers needed to cover the station's with the most traffic.  The desired outcome is to give the street teams the opportuntiy to connect with the highest number of individuals possible to gather email addresses for people interested in attending the annual gala and/or donating to the organization.

To start exploring this goal, I used the publically available MTA database for turnstile data from 1/1/2021 to 9/3/2021.

Pandas and matplotlib were used to clean, filter, sort and visualize the data.  One feature that describes the data is total entries per station YTD 9/3/2021.

The results suggest the highest volume of traffic is at 34th Street Penn Station.  Positioning volunteers at this station will be important to capturing people interested in supporting women in technology.

Note: Traffic volume is represented in scientific notation this value will be made clearer in the presentation.
