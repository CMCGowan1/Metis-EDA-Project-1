## WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY) - Street Team Placement Initial Analysis 

The goal of this project is to better understand which NYC area MTA subway stations have the most traffic and specifically which turnstiles per station have the most ENTIRES/EXITS between 4:OO and 20:00(4:00am - 8:00pm Eastern).  This analysis will provide insight into the minimum, maximum and average number of volunteers needed to cover the high velocity turnsitles at the station's with the most traffic.  The desired outcome is to give the street teams the opportuntiy to connect with the highest number of individuals possible to gather email addresses for people supportive of attending the annual gala and/or donating to the organization.



To start exploring this goal, I used the publically available MTA database for turnstile data from 1/1/2021 to 9/3/2021

## EXAMPLE
w datalinear regression model with one feature to describe Box Office Total Domestic Gross as a function of the Budget of a Movie.

The figure depicts the model (red) plotted against the actual data points. The prediction interval is plotted in green.

This result suggests that budget may have a significant positive impact on a film's revenue. However, the magnitude of the model's residuals makes it clear that budget is not the only important factor in determining the success of a film.
Notes: 
- Address your project's key question/purpose. 
- That doesn't mean they necessarily answer the question, but instead that they provide something immediately functional and useful that can receive feedback and be - built upon.
- "show us what you have so far that solves the problem"
